### Numeric types exercises

1. Given an integer number, print its last digit. 
1. Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.
1. Given the integer `N` - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight -
 how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock? 
 The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) 
 and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59). 
 For example, if `N = 150`, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - 
 i.e. now it's 2:30 am. So the program should print **2 30**.
